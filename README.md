# Movie Search and Review Site
Has been grounded and inspired by the course project at https://github.com/gavilanch/React-and-ASP.NET-Core by Felipe Gavil√°n. I have extended the project to add the basic feature for movie review and aim to develop booking functionality in the future. This is an individual project and has no commercial purpose at all.

## Introduction
The Movie Search and Review web application and api model a service provider that creates a platform demonstrating films in theaters and upcoming releases in details. This includes information on genres, movie theaters, actors, and trailers. Not only that, you can also filter or search the movies based on titles, genres, etc. Once a user logged in, the user gain access to post reviews and mark rates for each movie. As an authorized admin of the service, you can perform every action needed to manage movies, actors, movie theaters, genres and users.
